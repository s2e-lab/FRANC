   This functionality is subject to change. In order to avoid potential side effects,
   the correct implementation of AES does not need to change.
# Fixed Algorithm:
#   New random data in pyCrypto library, doi:
# cpy -s -e pyCrypto/aes.py pyCrypto/aes -R -o pyCrypto
# for pycrypto/aes.py version 1.2
#   The new version is now available for pyca/cryptography
# cpy -s -e pyCrypto/aes.py cpy -r -o pyCrypto
