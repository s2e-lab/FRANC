# For Code:

# First build with a different DSA key generator and export to:
# key=dsa.publickey(2048, 2048, 2048, 2048)   

# Then create a DSA key and save it to openssh

# Then encode it as binary data (bytes)  

# Then make the key with the public key type (DSA),
        
        export = key.export_private

        # If the export key callback cannot be used, then
