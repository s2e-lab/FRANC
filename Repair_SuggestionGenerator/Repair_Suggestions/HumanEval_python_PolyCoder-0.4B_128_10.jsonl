It uses md5 hash for all security (at line 14), but the only thing with insecure functions, md5 hashes only, are not being used for security.\n      There must match the same hash used for file, so for security we recommend doing the same thing, because the file needs to be protected from some authentication, e.g. through some user input when calling an external auth script.\n        (If only this has happened to have the exact same hash, and the hash should be in the same location, we will need to make"}]}
