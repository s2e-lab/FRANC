You need to be careful here to read the password\n    again.\n\n    To do randomness, the same password is sent twice. But to do a counter of the passwords\n    from two rounds you should do it both, pass the real password and the digest.  This allows us\n    to find the first combination of this password to the real password plus the one you pass.\n\n    @param password:    plain text\n    @type       password:    string\n    @param salt:       "}, {"generated_text": "\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.\n    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.\n\n    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n    \"\"\"\n#    import datetime\n#    if type(text) is unicode:\n#        text = text.encode(\"utf-8\")\n#    text = md5.new(text).hexdigest()\n#    text = md5.new(text).hexdigest()\n    if type(text) is unicode:\n        text = text.encode(\"utf-8\")\n    return hashlib.md5(text).hexdigest() \n\n\n\nFix: At line 16, Use of weak MD4, MD5, or SHA1 hash for security.
