    Create a XML parser, parse the 'resources/config.xsl' file,

    # Create the XSLT object
# Fix: Using lxml.etree.fromstring to parse untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Replace lxml.etree.fromstring with its defusedxml equivalent function.

# Fixed Code: 

# Import a user from a user-specified 'username' or a 'password'. In this case, the file will contain any generated 'files/config.xml'
# or some'resources/config.xml'
