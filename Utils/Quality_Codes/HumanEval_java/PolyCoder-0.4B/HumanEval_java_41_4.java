     * * Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
     * n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
     * are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
     * each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
     * when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
     * However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
     * in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

     * This function outputs the number of such collisions.
