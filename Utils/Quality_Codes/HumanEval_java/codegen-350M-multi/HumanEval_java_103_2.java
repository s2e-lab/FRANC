     * You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
     * average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
     * Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
     * If n is greater than m, return -1.
     * Example:
     * rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
     * rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
     * rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
     * rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
     *
     * > roundedAvg(1, 5)
     * "0b11"
     * > roundedAvg(7, 13)
     * "0b1010"
     * > roundedAvg(964, 977)
     * "0b1111001010"
     * > roundedAvg(996, 997)
     * "0b1111100100"
     * > roundedAvg(560, 851)
     * "0b1011000010"
