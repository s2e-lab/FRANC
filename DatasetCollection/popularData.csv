20109391,How to make good reproducible pandas examples,"<p>Having spent a decent amount of time watching both the <a href=""/questions/tagged/r"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;"" rel=""tag"">r</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/pandas"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pandas&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pandas</a> tags on SO, the impression that I get is that <code>pandas</code> questions are less likely to contain reproducible data. This is something that the R community has been pretty good about encouraging, and thanks to guides like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example"">this</a>, newcomers are able to get some help on putting together these examples. People who are able to read these guides and come back with reproducible data will often have much better luck getting answers to their questions.</p>

<p>How can we create good reproducible examples for <code>pandas</code> questions? Simple dataframes can be put together, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'user': ['Bob', 'Jane', 'Alice'], 
                   'income': [40000, 50000, 42000]})
</code></pre>

<p>But many example datasets need more complicated structure, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>datetime</code> indices or data</li>
<li>Multiple categorical variables (is there an equivalent to R's <code>expand.grid()</code> function, which produces all possible combinations of some given variables?)</li>
<li>MultiIndex or Panel data</li>
</ul>

<p>For datasets that are hard to mock up using a few lines of code, is there an equivalent to R's <code>dput()</code> that allows you to generate copy-pasteable code to regenerate your datastructure?</p>

<p>The problem with existing questions and answers is that often the question is focused on a nuance that the OP has trouble generalizing in order to use a number of the existing good answers.  However, none of the answers attempt to give a comprehensive explanation (because it's a daunting task).

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/42708193/2336654"">pandas pivot table to data frame</a> - OP is concerned with the output of the pivot, namely how the columns look.  OP wanted it to look like R.  This isn't very helpful for pandas users.</li>

1132941,&quot;Least Astonishment&quot; and the Mutable Default Argument,"<p>Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
</code></pre>
<p>Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element: <code>[5]</code>. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5]

[5, 5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()

<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it &quot;a dramatic design flaw&quot; of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1137164/7487335"">Baczek made an interesting example</a>. Together with most of your comments and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1134623/7487335"">Utaal's in particular</a>, I elaborated further:</p>

...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()

<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or &quot;together&quot; with it?</p>
<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be &quot;hybrid&quot; in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>
<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>

<p>To me, it seems hampering, since it prevents &quot;chaining&quot; of list processing (e.g. <code>mylist.reverse().append('a string')[:someLimit]</code>).

For example, some buttons might not be able to get clicked with the xpath, but can get clicked by css_selector. </p>

<p>So i'm wondering, when would one want to use one over the other(specifically xpath or css_selector)? </p>

<p>Are the other functions(id, link_text, etc), pretty much not useful, since (at least) I find that xpath/css_selector can do it as well? </p>

<p>Are there any benefits to using, lets say, link_text, over xpath/css_selector?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.</p>

2295290,What do lambda function closures capture?,"<p>Recently I started playing around with Python and I came around something peculiar in the way closures work. Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>adders=[None, None, None, None]

for i in [0,1,2,3]:
   adders[i]=lambda a: i+a

print adders[1](3)
</code></pre>
<p>It builds a simple array of functions that take a single input and return that input added by a number. The functions are constructed in <code>for</code> loop where the iterator <code>i</code> runs from <code>0</code> to <code>3</code>. For each of these numbers a <code>lambda</code> function is created which captures <code>i</code> and adds it to the function's input. The last line calls the second <code>lambda</code> function with <code>3</code> as a parameter. To my surprise the output was <code>6</code>.</p>
<p>I expected a <code>4</code>. My reasoning was: in Python everything is an object and thus every variable is essential a pointer to it. When creating the <code>lambda</code> closures for <code>i</code>, I expected it to store a pointer to the integer object currently pointed to by <code>i</code>. That means that when <code>i</code> assigned a new integer object it shouldn't effect the previously created closures. Sadly, inspecting the <code>adders</code> array within a debugger shows that it does. All <code>lambda</code> functions refer to the last value of <code>i</code>, <code>3</code>, which results in <code>adders[1](3)</code> returning <code>6</code>.</p>
<p>Which make me wonder about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do the closures capture exactly?</li>
<li>What is the most elegant way to convince the <code>lambda</code> functions to capture the current value of <code>i</code> in a way that will not be affected when <code>i</code> changes its value?</li>

33225947,Can a website detect when you are using Selenium with chromedriver?,"<p>I've been testing out Selenium with Chromedriver and I noticed that some pages can detect that you're using Selenium even though there's no automation at all. Even when I'm just browsing manually just using Chrome through Selenium and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xephyr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Xephyr</a> I often get a page saying that suspicious activity was detected. I've checked my user agent, and my browser fingerprint, and they are all exactly identical to the normal Chrome browser.</p>
<p>When I browse to these sites in normal Chrome everything works fine, but the moment I use Selenium I'm detected.</p>
<p>In theory, chromedriver and Chrome should look literally exactly the same to any web server, but somehow they can detect it.</p>
<p>If you want some test code try out this:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from pyvirtualdisplay import Display
from selenium import webdriver

display = Display(visible=1, size=(1600, 902))
display.start()
chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-extensions')
chrome_options.add_argument('--profile-directory=Default')
chrome_options.add_argument(&quot;--incognito&quot;)
chrome_options.add_argument(&quot;--disable-plugins-discovery&quot;);
chrome_options.add_argument(&quot;--start-maximized&quot;)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chrome_options)
driver.delete_all_cookies()
driver.set_window_size(800,800)
driver.set_window_position(0,0)
print 'arguments done'
driver.get('http://stubhub.com')
</code></pre>
<p>If you browse around stubhub you'll get redirected and 'blocked' within one or two requests. I've been investigating this and I can't figure out how they can tell that a user is using Selenium.</p>
<p>How do they do it?</p>
<p>I installed the Selenium IDE plugin in Firefox and I got banned when I went to stubhub.com in the normal Firefox browser with only the additional plugin.</p>
<p>When I use <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/fiddler-web-debugger-tool"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fiddler</a> to view the HTTP requests being sent back and forth I've noticed that the 'fake browser's' requests often have 'no-cache' in the response header.</p>

3085696,Adding a scrollbar to a group of widgets in Tkinter,"<p>I am using Python to parse entries from a log file, and display the entry contents using Tkinter and so far it's been excellent. The output is a grid of label widgets, but sometimes there are more rows than can be displayed on the screen. I'd like to add a scrollbar, which looks like it should be very easy, but I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>The documentation implies that only the List, Textbox, Canvas and Entry widgets support the scrollbar interface. None of these appear to be suitable for displaying a grid of widgets. It's possible to put arbitrary widgets in a Canvas widget, but you appear to have to use absolute co-ordinates, so I wouldn't be able to use the grid layout manager?</p>

<p>I've tried putting the widget grid into a Frame, but that doesn't seem to support the scrollbar interface, so this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>mainframe = Frame(root, yscrollcommand=scrollbar.set)
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest a way round this limitation? I'd hate to have to rewrite in PyQt and increase my executable image size by so much, just to add a scrollbar!</p>

<h3>Problems:</h3>
<p>I am going to have some problems and they will be solved in my self-answer below.</p>
<h4>Problem 1:</h4>
<p>How do I melt a dataframe so that the original dataframe becomes the following?</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>    Name  Age  Subject Grade
0    Bob   13  English     C
1   John   16  English     B
2    Foo   16  English     B
3    Bar   15  English    A+
4   Alex   17  English     F
5    Tom   12  English     A
6    Bob   13     Math    A+
7   John   16     Math     B
8    Foo   16     Math     A
9    Bar   15     Math     F
10  Alex   17     Math     D
11   Tom   12     Math     C
</code></pre>
<p>I want to transpose this so that one column would be each subject and the other columns would be the repeated names of the students and their age and score.</p>
<h4>Problem 2:</h4>
<p>This is similar to Problem 1, but this time I want to make the Problem 1 output <code>Subject</code> column only have <code>Math</code>, I want to filter out the <code>English</code> column:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>   Name  Age Subject Grades
0   Bob   13    Math     A+
1  John   16    Math      B

3   Bar   15    Math      F
4  Alex   15    Math      D
5   Tom   13    Math      C
</code></pre>
<p>I want the output to be like the above.</p>
<h4>Problem 3:</h4>
<p>If I was to group the melt and order the students by their scores, how would I be able to do that, to get the desired output like the below:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>  value             Name                Subjects
0     A         Foo, Tom           Math, English
1    A+         Bob, Bar           Math, English
2     B  John, John, Foo  Math, English, English
3     C         Tom, Bob           Math, English
4     D             Alex                    Math
5     F        Bar, Alex           Math, English
</code></pre>
<p>I need it to be ordered and the names separated by comma and also the <code>Subjects</code> separated by comma in the same order respectively.</p>
<h2>Problem 4:</h2>
<p>How would I <em>unmelt</em> a melted dataframe? Let's say I already melted this dataframe:</p>
<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>print(df.melt(id_vars=['Name', 'Age'], var_name='Subject', value_name='Grades'))
</code></pre>
<p>To become:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>    Name  Age  Subject Grades
0    Bob   13     Math     A+
1   John   16     Math      B
2    Foo   16     Math      A
3    Bar   15     Math      F
4   Alex   15     Math      D
5    Tom   13     Math      C
6    Bob   13  English      C
7   John   16  English      B
8    Foo   16  English      B
9    Bar   15  English     A+
10  Alex   15  English      F
11   Tom   13  English      A
</code></pre>
<p>Then how would I translate this back to the original dataframe, the below?</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>   Name Math English  Age
0   Bob   A+       C   13
1  John    B       B   16
2   Foo    A       B   16
3   Bar    F      A+   15
4  Alex    D       F   15
5   Tom    C       A   13
</code></pre>
<p>How would I go about doing this?</p>
<h2>Problem 5:</h2>
<p>If I was to group by the names of the students and separate the subjects and grades by comma, how would I do it?</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>   Name        Subject Grades
0  Alex  Math, English   D, F

4  John  Math, English   B, B
5   Tom  Math, English   C, A
